# DSA Practice - LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my curated repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems.  
This repository is primarily focused on solving problems from **LeetCode** using **Java** and **C++**.

## 💡 Purpose

- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews (FAANG/MAANG and beyond)
- Maintain clean and optimized solutions
- Build a searchable portfolio of solved problems

## Problem-Solving Topics:

### 📌 Topics Covered

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Trees**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
- **Graphs**
- And more...

## Directory Structure:

- **src/main/java/** - Java solutions
- **cpp** - C++ solutions

### How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
